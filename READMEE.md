## README.md

This project implements a simple book review application with a client-side user interface and a backend server for data management.

### Features

**Client-side:**

* **Home Page:** Lists all available books with details including title, author, description, and a cover image.
* **Search Functionality:** Allows users to search for books by title or author.
* **Book Details Page:** Displays detailed information about a specific book, including its reviews.
* **Review Submission:** Enables users to submit their own reviews with a rating and comment.
* **Responsive Design:** The UI adapts to different screen sizes for a good user experience.

**Backend server:**

* **Database:** Uses SQLite to store book and review data.
* **REST API:** Provides endpoints for:
    * Retrieving all books
    * Retrieving a specific book by ID (including its reviews)
    * Retrieving all reviews for a specific book
    * Creating a new review for a specific book
* **Data Validation:** Ensures that submitted reviews have valid data types.
* **Error Handling:** Handles database errors and invalid requests gracefully.

### Technologies Used

**Client-side:**

* **HTML:** Structure of the website.
* **CSS:** Styling of the UI.
* **JavaScript:** Interactivity and data fetching.
* **React.js:** JavaScript library for building dynamic user interfaces.
* **React Router:** Enables navigation between different pages in the application.

**Backend server:**

* **Node.js:** JavaScript runtime environment for the server.
* **Express.js:** Framework for building web applications in Node.js.
* **Sequelize:** Object-Relational Mapper (ORM) for interacting with the database.
* **SQLite:** Lightweight database for storing book and review data.
* **CORS:** Allows the client application to make requests to the backend server.

### Functionality

The book review application allows users to browse a list of books, search for specific books, view detailed information about individual books, and submit reviews for those books. The backend server handles data storage and retrieval, ensuring data consistency and security.

### Instructions

To run the application:

1. **Install Node.js and npm:** If you haven't already, download and install Node.js from [https://nodejs.org/](https://nodejs.org/). This will also install npm (Node Package Manager).

2. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/book-review-app.git
   ```

3. **Navigate to the server directory:**
   ```bash
   cd server
   ```

4. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

5. **Seed the database:**
   ```bash
   node seed.js
   ```

6. **Start the server:**
   ```bash
   node server.js
   ```

7. **Navigate to the client directory:**
   ```bash
   cd client
   ```

8. **Install client dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

9. **Start the client application:**
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

The application should now be accessible in your browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

### Further Development

This project serves as a basic example of a book review application. Potential improvements and features for future development include:

* **User Authentication:** Allow users to create accounts and log in.
* **User Profiles:** Enable users to maintain their own profiles with their submitted reviews.
* **Pagination:** Implement pagination for large book lists.
* **Advanced Search Filters:** Add more sophisticated search filters based on author, genre, publication date, etc.
* **Image Uploads:** Allow users to upload their own book cover images.
* **Database Scaling:** Migrate to a more robust database system like PostgreSQL or MySQL for larger datasets.
